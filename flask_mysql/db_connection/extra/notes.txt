okay so im trying to make the users_CR and I want to send info into the 
    database and then retrieve it in another html page.
    Im still new to the concept of session, but it looks like I wont be 
    using it in this case. I say that because I try using it like this:

@app.route('/create_user', methods=["POST"])
def create_user():
    data=[
        session["first_name"] == request.form["first_name"],
        session["last_name"] == request.form["last_name"],
        session["email"] == request.form["email"]
    ]

This does not work!
